Small typos in the Somap

[E R Berlekamp, J H Conway, R K Guy, Winning Ways, pages 912--913]

In honor of Richard Guy's 100 birthday, I've checked the Somap by computer,
and noticed a small number of glitches:

The edge from RL1b to RL1a should be labeled "wg".
The edge from RL2n to RL2l should be labeled "wg".
The edge from RL3d to WL2s should be labeled "wr".
The edge from O1k to O1f should be labeled "wy".
The edge from B3k to B6a should be labeled "ow".
The edge from R3k to R6a should be labeled "ow".
The edge from B6a to B6b should be labeled "wy", not "ow".
The edge from R6a to R6b should be labeled "wy", not "ow".

One should note that the dotted line from B3h to B3f does not pass through B4d.

It's interesting that B5f is the unique vertex of degree 7.

P.S. Richard initiated the Somap when he was living in Singapore, after
having found 234 distinct solutions. See Nabla 7 (December 1960), 151.
